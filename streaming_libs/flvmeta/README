This is FLVmeta, a metadata injection and manipulation tool for Adobe(r) FLV video files.

The package contains an utility, flvmeta, to be used to inject the onMetaData event
in FLV files as well as the onLastSecond event, to print all informations about
an input FLV file, as well as to check a file for validity.

The flvmeta utility is able to compute almost all known metadata tags,
including the keyframes list.
Since version 1.0.7, it has also been able to fix very large FLV files with
invalid 24-bit only timestamps to make proper use of 32-bit extended
timestamps.
Since version 1.0.8, it has been able to handle arbitrarily large files.

This project was started as an alternative to tools like flvtool2.
It is written in portable C, and should compile on most platforms (it has
been successfully compiled and tested on Ubuntu Feisty and later, Debian Lenny,
MacOSX 10.4, Windows XP, and Windows 7).
It also cleanly compiles as a 64-bit binary without alteration.
FLVmeta is fast (only bound by I/O speed) and has a very small memory footprint.

The FLVmeta source package includes and uses the following software:
- the libyaml YAML parser and emitter (http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML)
